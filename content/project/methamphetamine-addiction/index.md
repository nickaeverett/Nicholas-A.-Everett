The social and economic harm caused by methamphetamine addiction is escalating rapidly in Australia and globally, and there are no approved or effective pharmacotherapies for treating it.

My research into methamphetamine addiction has three main goals:
1. Develop and translate novel and effective pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine addiction to clinical trials. This research currently focusses on novel molecules created through industry partnerships between [Kinoxis Therapeutics](https://kinoxistherapeutics.com/) and [The Bowen Lab](https://thebowenlab.com), which stimulate the brain oxytocin system. This is inspired by research by myself and others showing that the neuropeptide oxytocin can powerfully reduce addiction symptoms in rodent models. 

2. Identify the key brain systems which maintain methamphetamine addiction and drive relapse. I use contemporary neuroscience techniques to discover the role of specific brain pathways in the pathology of methamphetamine addiction, and then screen novel pharmacotherapies for their action on these addiction-driving pathways. 

3. Describe the behavioural and neurobiological consequences of early life trauma on later-life addiction risk, and use this knowledge to identify pharmacotherapies which could rehabilitate the brain after the deleterious effects of early life trauma.
