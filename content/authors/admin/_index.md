Nick received his PhD in neuropsychopharmacology from Macquarie University with Prof Jennifer Cornish, where he used rat models of methamphetamine addiction to understand the efficacy and neural mechanisms of oxytocin as a novel therapy for reducing craving. 

In the Bowen Lab, Nick uses in vivo neural recording and manipulation techniques (fibre photometry, DREADDs) to identify the neurobiological mechanisms of action of novel pharmacotherapies, including KNX100, and uses newly developed operant models to identify treatments which promote social behaviour over drug taking, including oxytocin-receptor targeting molecules. 

Nick is also interested in the fundamental neurobiological mechanisms which regulate social motivation and social-decision making, particularly in the context of psychiatric disorders characterised by social dysfunction.
